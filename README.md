# TimCoRetailManager
At the end of the Build a TimCo Retail Manager App Course Series, Tim Corey invited us to take what we had started together and continue it into a demo project for our portfolio. This is that continuation of "A retail management system built by TimCo Enterprise Solutions".

## Roadmap

- [x] Create a new public repository in GitHub
- [x] Lay out the road map in the README.md file

- [ ] Update the .editorconfig file my idiosyncratic preferences and run code cleanup
- [ ] Update all the projects from .NET 5.0 to .NET 8.0
- [ ] Refactoring phase 1: create a common library for components common between the API and the UIs
- [ ] Refactoring phase 2: make code DRY and better implement SOLID where the added complexity does not outweigh the benefits
